<Title />

Buttons are used to trigger actions by clicking or tapping them. They are one of the main components used to control and affect an interface. Without buttons, well, hyperlinks would still be king, and that’d be hell.

Use buttons for primary actions on a page (Edit, Add, Save, Donate, Contact Us, Submit, etc.) Don’t use buttons as navigational elements, as these elements should use links. To support users who may be using keyboard navigation, hover states should be used as the button's focus state.



## Labels & Icons

Buttons need labels to help users understand what the button should be used for. A label is text inside a button that should clearly and succinctly indicate to a user what the result will be when clicking on the button.

  Icons can be used alongside labels to convey meaning and add visual flair. In some cases (especially in dense or small UI containers), icons may be able to stand on their own. This should be limited to universal functions (i.e. Add, Play, Delete).

  ## States

Buttons in our system have four base states: Default (also called Active), Hover, Pressed, Disabled. Unless a brand has a specific set of colors for Hover and Disabled, use opacity to show state change.

  ## Animation

  ### Audio

In our audio experiences, certain icon buttons (i.e. Play/Pause) have a subtle pulsing animation before being clicked. This animation stops once the user interacts with. Anytime the user clicks a play button, an animation of rotating half circles appears as a transition between the two play and pause icons to indicate to the user that the site is currently loading the audio stream for playback. If the user pauses audio, the pulsing animation around the play button resumes.


  ## Sizing

Choose button sizes according to their parent container and desired visibility. Radial has three sizes of buttons: Medium (our default), Small, and Large. Buttons sizes affect their icon size, text size, and internal padding. Width and height are fixed properties for most buttons, with Large buttons having flexibility in width.

  ## Accessibility

Button text and background color must meet the WCAG 2.0 contrast standards, requiring a minimum contrast ratio of 4.5.

  Icons buttons must contain a label clearly describing the purpose of the control.

## Variations

Radial offers four classes of buttons to help flex within a hierarchy from bold to subtle.

<Heading>Primary</Heading>

Primary buttons are reserved for the primary or most important action on a page. An example of a primary button is Donate.

            components: { VButton, AudioIcon },
            template: `

    </v-button>
`
        }}
    </Story>
</Canvas>

<Heading>Secondary</Heading>

Secondary buttons are used for secondary actions within an experience. Styles for secondary buttons can vary from brand to brand, but they must be less visually engaging then the primary button treatment. The common style for this is an outlined button. An example of a secondary button is TBD (not currently in production).

        {{
            components: { VButton, AudioIcon },
            template: `

      class="mod-secondary"
      label="Button"
    />
`
        }}
    </Story>
</Canvas>

<Heading>Icon</Heading>

What’s a primary button with an icon, but no label? It’s an icon button. You’ll see these a lot in our audio experiences. Use only when an icon's meaning is unambiguous.

    <Story name="Icon">
        {{
            components: { VButton, AudioIcon },

<Heading>Flat</Heading>

To the untrained eye, flat buttons might look like links. The difference here is that a button should always be linked to a call to action, while a link can be contextual. Flat buttons should be reserved for tertiary, less important actions. Examples of flat buttons include a call to Cancel, Show Details, or Hide. There is only one size of flat button.

<Canvas>
    <Story name="Flat">
        {{
            components: { VButton },
            template: `
    <v-button
      href="http://www.google.com"
      class="mod-flat"
      label="Button"
    />
`
        }}
    </Story>
