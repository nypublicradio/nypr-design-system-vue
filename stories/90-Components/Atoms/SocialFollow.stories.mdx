# Social Follow

The social follow component is a collection of linked social media icons and a piece of microcopy that allows users to connect with the brands social media accounts offsite.

## Use Cases

- Displaying social media accounts pertaining to a show.

- Displaying social media accounts pertaining to a person (such as an author, host, or producer).

- Displaying social media accounts pertaining to a brand

- Offering more ways for users to contact an entity.

## Whatâ€™s Inside

 
1- **Microcopy** - A short, action-oriented CTA that tells a user the intended action (i.e. "Connect with the show!", "Follow Us", "[Entity Name] Online")
  
2- **Social Media Icons** - Icons showing different social media sites, able to be hidden/shown based on relevancy

## Variants
Variants of social follow will typically only display changes in font style. Text and icon color can change as needed within accessible ranges.
