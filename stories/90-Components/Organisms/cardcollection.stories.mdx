# Card Collections

Similar to lists or grids, card collections allow for a grouping of content items to be aggregated and displayed across our various site templates. These collections are used to promote important content to users by showcasing those stories with more prominent, highlighted treatment in order to help them standout from the default treatment of other story cards on a given page. Editors can leverage this layout to display a depth of content around a given topic, or to show a variety of stories across key content areas. Story card collections can be curated manually by the editorial team through the CMS or dynamically when hard-coded into a page.


## Whatâ€™s Inside
Radial card collections can hold one to five story cards for promotion across various templates onsite, including homepage, section page, and curated topic page templates. The card collection can also support an optional title. This component currently leverages various combinations of the 1 across and 2 across card treatments in order to create layouts for multiple content items, with a maximum number of cards set to 5. As of now, this module will be planned for use on Gothamist homepage as 4 up, section page as 2 up, and curated topic page with flexibility for 1-5.



1- **Optional Title** - Collection title/label. This is optional.

2- **Cards** - 1-5 cards are stacked according to container width, leveraging all current card molecule rules.
