# Card Collections

Similar to lists or grids, card collections allow for a grouping of one to five pieces of content to be displayed in a variety of site templates.


## Whatâ€™s Inside
Radial card collections can hold one to five cards for promotion across various templates onsite. The card collection can also support an optional title. This component currently leverages various combinations of the 1 across and 2 across to create layouts for multiple content items, with a maximum number of cards set to 5. As of now, this module will be planned for use on Gothamist homepage as 4 up, section page as 2 up, and curated tag page with flexibility for 1-5.



1- **Optional Title** - Collection title/label. This is optional.

2- **Cards** - 1-5 cards are stacked according to container width, leveraging all current card molecule rules.
