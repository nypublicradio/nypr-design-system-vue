# Switcher

The Switcher organism is used to navigate or control different areas/panels/windows within a page. Users can select only one option at a time, like a radio button (link to radio button documentation to come).

## Use Cases

- As a control, to switch between two or more options within a page (eg. Light Mode or Dark Mode).

- As a selector, to pick between two or more choices within a form (eg. Monthly Donation or Annual Donation).

- As a stream selector, to pick between two or more stream options within a streaming experience.

## What’s Inside

Switchers contain objects called Switcher Cards. A switcher must contain a minimum of two switcher cards, but does not have a maximum limit at this time. Our whitelabel switcher card has an optional icon and line of text.

1- **Icon** - Optional icon related to the choice, in cases like WNYC, this is animated.

2- **Text** - Description choice or option. This should not be written as an action, eg. "Click for Dark Mode," but as a noun, eg. "Dark Mode."

## Placement

Switchers that change a user’s experience should typically be towards the top or upper bounds of the page, following the logic that something that creates global changes should have a higher hierarchy. Switchers used in forms or as inputs should be left aligned with other inputs.

## Animation

On page load, one option will be selected by default. When a user navigates to select another option, the switcher should animate to “switch” to the new chosen option.

Switcher cards should include hover states to afford interactivity.

## Variants

### WNYC

<img

  src="./images/Organisms-Switcher-WNYC.png"
  width="500"
/>

In our WNYC Lab version, the switcher is used in a live radio streaming context to change between radio streams.

## Mobile Scrolling

If a switcher component is too long for the viewport width of a mobile device, the Switcher has optional horizontal scrolling capabilities. This should be turned on by default.

## Accessibility

- Each switcher card must have a unique title that clearly describes the card. This helps users of assistive technologies get the information they need to effectively navigate the UI.

- Text, icons, and background color must meet WCAG 2.0 [minimum contrast](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/contrast-minimum.html) requirement.

- Use alt texts or descriptive labels for icons

## Testing and Iterations

## Configurations
Although this configuration is not currently in use, the switcher has the ability to stack vertically.
