# Author Page

Author pages should allow a user to be introduced to an author she is interested in, to follow or contact her easily, and most importantly, to find additional content by that author that might be of interest.

For users of NYPR who are currently members or transitioning towards membership, it is important to showcase the value of our brand and our brand's voices. By exposing more information about the author at the article page and author page levels, we are allowing our users to identify with and recognize our authors as being significant towards their daily experience with the brand.

## What's Inside


1- **Leaderboard Ad Placeholder** - Visual placeholder for a long Leaderboard-type ad if required.

2- **[Site Header]()** - Primary navigation for the webpage, responsive and highly flexible.

3- **Author Card** - Not yet a component. Contains the person component, and social follow.

5- **[Card Collection (List)](https://storybook.nypr.digital/latest/index.html?path=/docs/components-organisms-card-collection--right-rail)** - A collection of stories from the author in question, layout to be changed as needed.

5- **More Results Button** - Loads more of the collection above when clicked (display if there is more to load).

6- **Back to Top Button** - Simple button that scrolls the page to the top when clicked.

7- **[Footer](https://storybook.nypr.digital/latest/index.html?path=/docs/components-organisms-footer--footer-config-1)** - Description of thing and any underlying logic within it.
