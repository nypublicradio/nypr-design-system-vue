# Tag Page

Often used by Marketing or Editorial teams to create temporary collections, Tag pages can also be used for content discovery to create more evergreen collections of content that would not typically be surfaced in a siteâ€™s main Navigation. These pages are important to maintain for SEO, as they help the sites get bumped up in priority when indexed by a search engine.

Tag Pages dynamically return results for all content with a specific Tag associated in reverse chronological order. There functionality is similar to that of a Category Page.
