# Search Results

These list pages are typically displayed as a result of user input or as a shortcut to providing related content (ie, a list of articles written by an Author, or articles with similar keywords).

## What's Inside

1- **Leaderboard Ad Placeholder** - Visual placeholder for a long Leaderboard-type ad if required.

2- **[Site Header]()** - Primary navigation for the webpage, responsive and highly flexible.

3- **Text Field** - An text field filled with the last search term, used to refine/change search without leaving the page.

5- **[Card Collection (List)](https://storybook.nypr.digital/latest/index.html?path=/docs/components-organisms-card-collection--right-rail)** - A collection of search results, layout to be changed as needed.

6- **More Results Button** - Loads more of the collection above when clicked.

7- **Back to Top Button** - Simple button that scrolls the page to the top when clicked.

8- **[Footer](https://storybook.nypr.digital/latest/index.html?path=/docs/components-organisms-footer--footer-config-1)** - Description of thing and any underlying logic within it.
