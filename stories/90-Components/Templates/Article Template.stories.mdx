# Article Template

The standard article template is our core storytelling tool and the most important piece of our editorial system. Articles are text-based but can contain other media. This template is built to work with Aviary in a way that's easy-to-use and adaptable. The article template should help editors using our CMS create meaningful digital content that matters to our users.

## Use Cases

-   The article template is used to inform and educate readers on key information for their daily lives. This is primarily a visual/reading template rather than an audio-based template, though it may have some audio or video elements embedded within."

Flexible components like the ones we're building might have more than one variant. Demonstrate any different forms of the component here.

### Breaking News Banner
<img alt="Breaking News Banner" src="./images/Templates-Article-BreakingNewsBanner.png" width="500" />

The [Breaking News Banners](https://storybook.nypr.digital/latest/index.html?path=/docs/components-molecules-breaking-news-banners--default-story) will be used to display important information that matters to our users in a prominent and eye-catching way, on Gothamist, this used to alerting users of growing news stories.

### Product Marketing Banner
<img alt="Product Marketing Banner" src="./images/Templates-Article-ProductMarketingBanner.png" width="500" />

[Callout Banners](https://storybook.nypr.digital/latest/index.html?path=/docs/components-molecules-callout-banners--default-story) are notifications that can inform the user of a change on the website or of an event that may be of interest. Most often, banners are used for marketing or product marketing messages.

## Accessibility
Lest we forget the things that make these components ***usable***. Any considerations serving screen readers, contrast requirements, or other accessibility rules can go here.


## Testing and Iterations
There is a lot to be explored in the realm of audio content within articles. Whether it's audio snipped or spoken articles, our two majors forms of content here at NYPR can benefit eachother when interlaced together smartly. We hope to use this template as a jumping off point to test and explore that space.
