# Social Follow

The social follow component is a collection of linked social media icons and a piece of microcopy that encourages users to connect and engage with brands through their social media accounts offsite.

This component is similar to our "Social Share" component, but is specific to following or contacting brand/person social media pages rather than sharing content to a user's personal social media page.

## Use Cases

- Linking to social media accounts pertaining to a show (such as The Brian Lehrer Show, The Takeaway, or All Of It).

- Linking to social media accounts pertaining to a person (such as an author, host, or producer).

- Linking to social media accounts pertaining to a brand (such as Gothamist, WNYC, or WQXR).

- Offering more ways for users to contact or engage with an entity above.

            components: { ShareTools, ShareToolsItem },
     template: `
<div class="sbdocs-large-container sbdocs-container-margin">
<share-tools label="Connect">
<share-tools-item service="facebook" username="WNYC" />

1- **Microcopy** - A short, action-oriented CTA that tells a user the intended action (eg. "Connect with the show!", "Follow Us", "[Entity Name] Online")

2- **Social Media Icons** - Icons displaying logos of different social media sites, able to be hidden/shown based on relevancy. Whitelabel defaults to show Twitter, Facebook, and Youtube, but up to 5 icons can be listed.

## Variants
Variants of social follow will typically only display changes in font style. Text and icon color can change as needed within accessible ranges. According to where the component is being used, it may include more or fewer icons based on the social media pages available for that brand, person, or show.

### WNYC Variation

## Default State

The default state takes only a `handle` argument and returns a component that
displays a "Follow Us" label, and three icons linked to their appropriate
networks: Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

**Note:** If handles are different between social networks (e.g. `WNYC` vs.
`WNYCRadio`), please use the *Component Block* version of this component to take
full control over the component's presentation.



## Overriding the "Follow Us" Label

The "Follow Us" label can be overridden (because "us" may not be appropriate
for every use-case) via the `@label` argument:



## Overriding / Re-arranging Social Networks via Component Block

The component can also be used as a higher order component so that you can have
complete control over a) which social networks are displayed, b) what order
they are displayed in, and c) the full URL that they link to.

This format requires you pass the full `@href` attribute into the sub-component in
order for it to correctly link.

**Note**: You *must* use this format if the social media handles differ between
social networks (e.g. if Facebook was "WNYC" while Twitter used lower-case "wnyc").

In the below example, we've moved Twitter to be the *first* social network
displayed, and have removed Instagram entirely

## Accessibility
-   Text, icons, and background color must meet WCAG 2.0  [minimum contrast](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/contrast-minimum.html)  requirement.
-   Use alt texts or descriptive labels for icons
