# Person

Our person component displays a visual depiction of an author or host along with text fields for name and role.

## Use Cases

-   Displaying the author or producer of a written or produced piece of content
    
-   Displaying the host and/or guest of a radio show or podcast
    

## What’s Inside



1- **Image** - An image of the person, or a placeholder image if none is provided. Can be made a clickable link out to a relevant page (i.e. twitter profile, bio, author page.)
    
2- **Name** - Name of person, required for this component. Can be made a clickable link out to a relevant page (i.e. twitter profile, bio, author page.)
    
3- **Role** - Role or subtitle, optional. In the case of Gothamist’s “Contributing Organization” authors, the organization can be listed here concluding or replacing the role. ex: Jess Fisher, Writer (NYT) or  Jess Fisher, NYT


## Cropping

It is recommended that square profile pictures are used, with the subject centered. Using landscape or portrait orientated photos might result in unwanted cropping.

## Variants

### **WNYC**
<img alt="text" src="/images/Molecules-Person-WNYC.png" width="300" />

The WNYC variant is used to display show hosts and guests using our WNYC theme fonts and colors.

## Configurations
The person component can be arranged horizontally or vertically. Horizontal is the preferred and default configuration, but vertical is useful on mobile or when listing many people.

## Accessibility
- Text, icons, and background color must meet WCAG 2.0 [minimum contrast](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/contrast-minimum.html) requirement.

- Always include an alt attribute describing the information that is visually displayed in the image.


## Testing and Iterations
Any updates/progress to this component can be listed out here. Maybe eventually this will be automated.
