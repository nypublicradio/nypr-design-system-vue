**Image** - An image of the person, or a placeholder image if none is provided. Can be made a clickable link out to a relevant page (eg. author page, twitter profile, bio ). a circle mask can be applied by using the "circle" prop. An animated GIF can be used, but will stop animating after 10 seconds. Size can be altered in the vertical orientation only using "img-scale" prop. This value is a percentage of the wisth of the available area.

**Video** - An optional promotional video can be triggered to play with a PLAY button placed over the image.

**Name** - Name of person, required for this component. Can be made a clickable link out to a relevant page (eg. author page, twitter profile, bio ).

**Role** - Role or subtitle, optional. In the case of Gothamist’s “Contributing Organization” authors, the organization can be listed here concluding or replacing the role. ex: Jess Fisher, Writer (NYT) or  Jess Fisher, NYT

**Organization** - When provided, it will be added after the Role in parentheses. If the "organization-link" is provided, it will be a clickable link to the organization. 

**Blurb** - A paragraph or so about the author, their credentials, and other information they wish to share with readers, optional. This blurb can be optionally truncated to a certain number of lines with the "truncate" prop.

**[Social](https://storybook.nypr.digital/latest/index.html?path=/docs/components-molecules-social-follow--horizontal)** - Social media links to the persons social accounts.



## Image Cropping

It is recommended that square profile pictures are used, with the subject centered. Using landscape or portrait orientated photos might result in unwanted cropping.

## Variants

### **WNYC**
<img alt="text" src="./images/Molecules-Person-WNYC.png" width="300" />

The WNYC variant is used to display show hosts and guests using our WNYC theme fonts and colors.

### **Gothamist**
<img alt="text" src="./images/Molecules-Person-Gothamist.png" width="531" />

The Gothamist variant is used to display authors, reporters, and staff, optionally including their bio and social media links.


## Configurations
The person component can be arranged horizontally(default) or vertically. Horizontal is the preferred and default configuration, but vertical is useful on mobile or when listing many people. A responsive configuration is also available. This will make it start horizontal and change to vertical at the SMALL break point or lower.

## Accessibility
- Text, icons, and background color must meet WCAG 2.0 [minimum contrast](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/contrast-minimum.html) requirement.

- Always include an alt attribute describing the information that is visually displayed in the image.


## Testing and Iterations
In the future when the person component gets integrated with Gothamist, the component will have to be updated to support Contrubuting Organization metadata. This metadata will be appended to the Role text and wrapped in parentheses.
