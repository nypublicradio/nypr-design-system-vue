# Person

Our person component displays a visual depiction of an author or host along with fields for name, role, bio, and social links.

## Use Cases

-   Displaying the author or producer of a written or produced piece of content

-   Displaying the host and/or guest of a radio show or podcast


## What’s Inside

<Canvas>
    <Story name="Person default">
        {{
            components: { VPerson },
            template: `
<v-person
    image="./images/Placeholder-Image-1_1.png"
/>
`
        }}
    </Story>
</Canvas>


1- **Image** - An image of the person, or a placeholder image if none is provided. Can be made a clickable link out to a relevant page (eg. twitter profile, bio, author page).

2- **Name** - Name of person, required for this component. Can be made a clickable link out to a relevant page (eg. twitter profile, bio, author page).

3- **Role** - Role or subtitle, optional. In the case of Gothamist’s “Contributing Organization” authors, the organization can be listed here concluding or replacing the role. ex: Jess Fisher, Writer (NYT) or  Jess Fisher, NYT

4- **Bio** - A paragraph or so about the author, their credentials, and other information they wish to share with readers, optional.

5- **[Social Follow](https://storybook.nypr.digital/latest/index.html?path=/docs/components-molecules-social-follow--horizontal)** - Social media links to the persons social accounts.

6- **Optional Link** - Can be used to as an external or internal link as needed, optional. 


## Cropping

It is recommended that square profile pictures are used, with the subject centered. Using landscape or portrait orientated photos might result in unwanted cropping.

## Variants

### **WNYC**
<img alt="text" src="./images/Molecules-Person-WNYC.png" width="300" />

The WNYC variant is used to display show hosts and guests using our WNYC theme fonts and colors.

### **Gothamist**
<img alt="text" src="./images/Molecules-Person-Gothamist.png" width="531" />

The Gothamist variant is used to display authors, reporters, and staff, optionally including their bio and social media links.


## Configurations
The person component can be arranged horizontally or vertically. Horizontal is the preferred and default configuration, but vertical is useful on mobile or when listing many people.

## Accessibility
- Text, icons, and background color must meet WCAG 2.0 [minimum contrast](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/contrast-minimum.html) requirement.

- Always include an alt attribute describing the information that is visually displayed in the image.


## Testing and Iterations
In the future when the person component gets integrated with Gothamist, the component will have to be updated to support Contrubuting Organization metadata. This metadata will be appended to the Role text and wrapped in parentheses.
