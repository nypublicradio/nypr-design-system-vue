# Factboxes
Factbox components are used to highlight key pieces of information related to a given story in order to keep audiences informed of what matters by displaying that information in a graphic way that is separate from the rest of the story. They are designed to accommodate a variety of content, which may include but is not limited to: key facts, highlights lists, ancillary paragraphs, or blurbs. Compared to the wider “Need to Know” box that appears at the beginning of an article, factboxes appear as an aside, next to the body of a story in desktop, and above or below paragraphs in mobile.

You can find the instructions for populating these elements in the CMS here:

### Rules
The content of a factbox can be formatted using a variety of content options: an image, a numbered list, a bulleted list, a timeline, and a paragraph can be used individually or as a mix-and-match group. Images are always captioned with a description and source.

If used, an image will always be displayed as the first item in the factbox, under the headline and before any text. Text-based formats (numbered lists, bulleted lists, timelines, and paragraphs) can be ordered in the factbox in whatever way best suits the content.

Though the order of content in a factbox is flexible, four examples of how a factbox can be formatted are shown below.
