# Timestamp


Timestamp displays information related to the date or time. Current usage includes, but is not limited to, time metadata in the [Article Metadata](https://nypublicradio.github.io/nypr-design-system/?path=/docs/components-molecules-article-metadata--page) and [Card](https://nypublicradio.github.io/nypr-design-system/?path=/docs/components-molecules-cards--page) components. 


  

## Fields
This component includes optional description text, which can be used to help contextualize time in relation to a piece of content to the user. On a news story, publish date and updated date labels are examples of how this might be used. This descriptor text is flexible to be relevant to the organism/context it is used within.

<Canvas>
    <Story name="Default">
        {{
            components: {
    TimeStamp
  },
  template: `
    <div class="sbdocs-large-container sbdocs-container-margin">
      <time-stamp date1="January 28, 2019 1:25PM" date2="February 1, 2019 10:08AM" date2Label="Updated:" />
    </div>`
        }}
    </Story>
</Canvas>

**Publish Date** - Time when the content was originally published.

**Updated Date** - Time when the content was last updated.

  

## Formatting Time
Timestamps follow a 12-hour clock and should include an “am” or “pm” to ensure that times of day are clearly communicated. Capitalization of "am" or "pm" is left to the discretion of the brand. When seen onsite, time is displayed according to the user's timezone. This variable calculation is handled by Aviary.

If time is within the current **year**, do not display the year, format like: "Month D, h:mm a"

If time is **more than** 24 hrs in the past format like: "Month D, YYYY h:mm a"

If time is **less than** 24 hrs in the past format like: "N hours ago"

*If time is **less than** or equal to 5 minutes in the past format like: "Just Now"

*Just Now is best used with time-sensitive content like front page news or new content. This formatting option should be able to be turned on and off.

## Formatting Date
Date terminals such as "th" or "st” (ex: April 30th) are not used. Days of the week should never be abbreviated and can be turned on and off as needed.

## Timestamp on Cards

To reduce clutter and save horizontal space, certain timestamp fields display differently on cards.

**Months** are abbreviated to the following:

Jan, Feb, March, April, May, June, July, Aug, Sept, Oct, Nov, Dec
