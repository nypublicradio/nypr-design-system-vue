# Accessibility

Helpful guidelines/links for accessibility compliance.

## Best Practices, Process and Policy

### Policy

The NYPR digital team designs and builds websites and applications with accessibility best practices in mind, using a variety of tools to test compliance in all stages of the design and development process. Our goal is for all new products to be [WCAG 2.0 AA Compliant](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/).

-   [Official NYPR policy](https://media.wnyc.org/media/resources/2019/Mar/11/NYPR_Web_Accessibility_Policy_2019.pdf)


### Process

-   Digital team uses a variety of tools to check compliance in all stages of the software development process: from UI/Wireframes creation to design, development and QA. For the full list, see the Tools section.

-   Test cases contain accessibility requirements in the acceptance criteria

-   QA team conducts a combination of manual and automated tests for accessibility per requirements, using a combination of the above tools.

-   Coordinate a special user testing group for accessibility based on the list from Listener Services.

-   Team shares articles and industry news/best practices in #accessibility slack channel
