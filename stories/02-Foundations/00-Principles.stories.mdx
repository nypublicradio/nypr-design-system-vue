# Radial Design Principles

The Radial Design System consists of the user-focused design patterns and components that power the digital presence of our brands. These principles and our library of components provide the framework to build great storytelling platforms and a cohesive user experience. The team uses these principles as filters to determine what goes into the system, what’s custom and what is not.


### _Inclusive_ 💕

Build for all our users, internally and externally.

### _Documented_ 📝

Record our decisions as part of the design and build process, it serves our team and the team after us.

### _Connective_ 🤝

Work to make the gaps within and between Digital and NYPR a little smaller.

### _Content-centered_ 🎧

Radial is in service to the content on our platforms. We’re building storytelling tools.

### _Flexible, but focused_ 🤺

Keep configurability grounded in real uses-cases. Design for reusability and efficiency.
