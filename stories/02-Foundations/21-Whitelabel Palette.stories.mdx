### Whitelabel Pallete

Our Whitelabel uses a minimal yet functional palette to communicate best practices of Primary, Utility, and Accent colors.

WHITELABEL COLOR SWATCHES  (PRIMARY / UTILITY / ACCENT)

**Cool Blue** is the primary color for CTAs, buttons, or interactive elements. **Ceramic Blue** can be used as a header color or background color for larger, prominent components. **Sky Blue** is purely a decorative lighter alternative. **Gray Dark** is our primary text color, including headers, body text, and small text. **Cool White** is an alternative background-color. **Ember Red** is used solely for errors or warnings and **Sea Green** for success messaging or confirmations.

### Color Groups
Color groups help predetermine foreground colors based on background color. Whitelabel has two color groups, light and dark.
