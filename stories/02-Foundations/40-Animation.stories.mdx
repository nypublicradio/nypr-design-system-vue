# Animation

Radial uses animation to convey utility and express brand. Used selectively, animation brings a page to life, helping users focus and navigate UI.

## Usage

Animation is currently used around buttons and interactive items. They can be as simple as a hover effect, or as nuanced as a loading animation. Animations should only be used if they add something to the user experience, don’t include animations solely to be flashy.

## Easing and Timing

Easing is a control for the velocity of an animation over it’s duration. Timing relates to how long that animation lasts. These two variables make up web animation control in radial. Currently, there are three tokens in Radial for easing, outlined below.

  ### Outgoing
   Elements exiting a view use Outgoing easing, starting at rest and ending at peak velocity.

    cubic-bezier(0.4, 0.0, 1, 1);

  #### Example: Slide out animation used in banners for dismissal.

  ### Incoming
  Elements entering a view use Incoming easing, in which transitions begin at peak velocity and end at rest.

    cubic-bezier(0.0, 0.0, 0.2, 1);

  #### Example: Pop up animation used for banners or lazy-loading content.

 ### Standard
 Standard easing brings attention to the end of an animation by taking more time to decelerate than accelerate. This is the most common form of easing.


    cubic-bezier(0.4, 0.0, 0.2, 1);

  #### Example: Color transition animation used as a hover state for buttons. Can express brand colors.

## Lottie Animations

<Canvas>
    <Story name="Lottie Animations Example">
        {{
            components: { AudioWaveIsActive },
            template: `
    <span class="o-icon u-icon--l">
      <audio-wave-is-active />
    </span>
`,
        }}

## Accessibility

If building new/custom animations become necessary keep the following in mind:



### Screen reader performance
Animations can affect the way screen-readers convey information; messing up order, causing delays, or skipping information entirely. When building new animations, test accessibility for screen reading.

### Vestibular Disorders
Users with vestibular disorders might experience heavy motion on a page to be unpleasant, disorienting, or even nauseating. If an experience demonstrates intense movement or full-page animation, please give due notice in the form of a banner or notification.
